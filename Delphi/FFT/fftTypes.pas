{ Unit fftTypes

  This unit provides the basic floating point type for units based
  on this mathematical library.

  TFloat is the basic floating point type and can be set to single
  (4 byte) or double (8 byte), or any other type. Please note that
  processor instructions are well optimised for single and double
  and less for other types.
